# Fuzzy Model-Based Image Smoothing and Sharpening

This repository contains a Python script for performing fuzzy model-based image smoothing and sharpening. The script processes an input image using a fuzzy membership function to reduce noise and sharpen the image.

## Overview

The script follows these key steps:
1. **Fuzzy Vector Smoothing**: This step applies a fuzzy logic-based method to smooth the image, reducing noise while preserving important features.
2. **Fuzzy Model-Based Sharpening**: This step sharpens the smoothed image using a fuzzy model-based approach to enhance edges and details.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need the following Python packages installed:

- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scipy
